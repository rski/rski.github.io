  <p>2015 Imperial College London graduate. Currently working at Intracom Telecom Greece as a DevOps engineer.</p>

  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p>I enjoy <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22642100-rom>books</a> [Goodreads] and completed a reading challenge in 2015 by reading <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/2925698> 60 books (and some comics)</a> [Goodreads]. When circumstances allowed I also tried my hand at <a href=https://fitocracy.com/profile/rski>Olympic Weightlifting</a> [Fitocracy] and occasionally put effort in cooking.</p>

  <h1>Programming Interests</h1>
  <p>An overview of some of the languages I have used in the past can be found <a href=http://resume.github.io/?rski>here</a> [github]. My Beng project was parallelising parts of the Testu01 library, specifically {small,,Big} Crush.</p>
  <p>My preferred editor is (neo)vim, my configuration for which can be found <a href="https://github.com/rski/dotfiles">here</a> [github], along with all my configuration files. I sometimes use spacemacs, since vim cannot compare with its REPL integration.</p>
  <p>I've also written <a href=https://github.com/rski/vim-tohebi>vim-tohebi</a> [github], a vim plugin which finds configuration files on a per-project basis.</p>

  <h1>Contact</h1>
  <p>I can be found on <a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/rskiad>LinkedIn</a> and my Freenode name is rski. A possibly outdated CV is available <a href=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rs3011/RskiCV.pdf>here</a> [doc.ic.ac.uk].</p>

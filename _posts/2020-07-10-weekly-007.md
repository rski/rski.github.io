# Work

I'm ~~writing~~ reading C++14/17 again and it's certainly something, considering that C+11 was barely a thing when I entered uni. It almost makes me feel old. clangd is good and I'm glad it exists. Tags almost work too, but clang is better if you have the RAM to spare. Thankfully I do, almost 300gigs is more than enough.

# Reading

I'm working through the Goog SRE book, right after stopping my SRE work at Arista. Go figure. It's a fun and interesting book regardless, I keep wondering though, is it Google propaganda? Is it why people leave their SWE positions in other companies to do SRE in Google?

# Misc

I've been on a quest to make reading feeds a good, curated source of info and longer reading material and it's going well. This week I dug a bit and found out that you can track github releases using `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases.atom`. I use it to track gopls and golangci-lint releases.

[Discussing Pointer Provenance](http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2019/p1434r0.html) and the [tweet](https://twitter.com/rep_stosq_void/status/1280919968243212288)[^1] that made me look this up.

[On moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/hnfnti/where_is_the_rust_community_allowed_to_talk_about/fxf65nf/), I liked the concept of being able to rate limit replies on heated topics. If I (n)ever build a platform like reddit and co, I'll keep it in mind.

# Mid-Weeknotes 002

# Reading

- [How the Boeing 737 Max disaster looks to a software developer](https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/how-the-boeing-737-max-disaster-looks-to-a-software-developer)

    I haven't been more terrified of software since playing Arx Fatalis in
    my early teens. I don't particularly like flying and reading these
    sorts of articles doesn't help. Still, this was way too interesting to
pass on.

    I just want to note, I definitely read this, for some reason it seems to be behind a paywall now.

- [Introduction to Lambda Calculus](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/geuvers.pdf)
    by Barend(regt|sen). Went through the first half of Chapter 2 again.

- Getting to Yes

    Chapters 2 and 3. I've returned to keeping notes in ~/org/books/<bookname>.org and it feels nice and useful.

- [Parser Combinators in Rust](https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/)

    I started reading it, life comes at you fast sometimes.


Not much else in the way of words, maybe more next week. Having a weekly roundup does help with accountability and keeping honest with yourself.

# Cooking

The cast iron works after the reseasoning and it feels better somehow. Who am I to question that mushrooms seem like they taste better now?

# Work

Stumbled upon a bug in [go-fsnotify](https://github.com/aristanetworks/fsnotify), where a write event has a 0x0 mask. There's a deterministic reproduction case for it, it's a bit weird no one else has run into it before. Onto the stack for next week.

# Emacsen

I set up lsp for python, go and rust mode. Sometimes it makes Emacs quite sluggish, that needs to be looked into.

I'm also trying to make flycheck and mypy work. `flycheck-mypy` doesn't seem to work. So far I've tried

```elisp
(use-package flycheck-mypy
  :defer nil
  :config (require 'flycheck-mypy))
```

which seems like it should work, `flycheck-verify-setup` reports it as working, but I don't see anything happening.

This does work though:

```elisp
(defun mypy()
  (interactive)
  (compile (format "mypy --py2 %s --ignore-missing-imports" (buffer-file-name))))
```

An finally I fixed my push to gerrit bindings for magit, thanks to [Alex](https://github.com/AlexKraak/emacs).

# Life

and Death.

Not a fantastic week on this front. Lyra and Joel set the tune for this week.

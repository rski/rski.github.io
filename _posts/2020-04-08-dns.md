# Things I learned today about DNS

- Docker copies DNS settings into containers

<https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#dns-services>

And they are inherrited once and for all, so if you start a container and connect to a vpn, the DNS configuration of the container is now stale.

- Dig doesn't resolve the same way as Python

        python3 -c "import socket; socket.getaddrinfo(\"example.com\", 9999)"

is quite different from

        dig example.com

- Python doesn't resolve the same way as Python

It all depends on libc, and musl libc is really not the same as glibc:

<https://wiki.musl-libc.org/functional-differences-from-glibc.html#Name-Resolver/DNS>

- NixOS + Network Manager + VPN can enjoy leaking DNS queries

On connecting to a vpn, NetworkManager might add new nameservers, and might not delete the existing ones, such as

        nameserver 192.168.1.1

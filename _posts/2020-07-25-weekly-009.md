# Work

Nothing particularly interesting. I gave an internal intro talk on _nix_. At least two people had asked me about using it and I thought I might as well put some slides together and ramble for an hour or so about the stuff _nix_ can do.

# Reading

I'm reading the SRE book, still. I'm about halfway through, it's a bit hard to read without a reason to do it. I _have_ gotten quite a bit of usefull knowledge out of it, now it feels like the returns are diminishing a bit and I want to read something else.
I did start _C++ Concurrency in Action_, which is an absolute banger of a book. The author worked on the C++ std concurrency, so the book is very much in depth, and a lot of first person explanations of why some APIs were designed work one way or another.
